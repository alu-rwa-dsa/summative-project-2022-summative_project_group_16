# Data Structures and Algorithms Summative Project

## Project Title: E-Commerce Order Tracking Algorithm

## About Project
Our Project involves creating a simple Shirt online store where when the user places an order, 
the order details are stored in a hash table and an order number is generated which when inputted in the program, 
it will display the exact details of the corresponding order

## Our Solution
There have been reports by customers who use online shopping that they have received the wrong orders. 
For example, if a customer orders a pink shoe, they will receive a red one. This brings about customer dissatisfaction which is bad for a business.
Our solution is aimed at tackling this problem by providing an efficient way of storing a customer's order details to prevent the sending of wrong orders.
The e-commerce industry is set to benefit greatly from this solution as it will bring about customer satisfaction which is great for business as this will increase sales
